   Detailed review of equities, commodities, forwards, futures, and options, establishing theoretical underpinnings.

2. **Discrete-Time Option Pricing**  
   Study and implementation of the Binomial model to price European and American options with stepwise computational algorithms.

3. **Continuous-Time Option Pricing**  
   Derivation and numerical implementation of the Black-Scholes model for European call options and hedging portfolios.

4. **Option Price Sensitivities**  
   Analysis of European call option price, delta, and related sensitivities as functions of stock price.

5. **Partial Differential Equations in Finance**  
   Numerical solutions of the Black-Scholes PDE for European and American options using stable and accurate methods.

6. **Monte Carlo Simulation Techniques**  
   Application of Monte Carlo methods to simulate asset price dynamics and compute option values under stochastic frameworks.

7. **Sensitivity and Risk Analysis**  
   Computation and interpretation of Greeks to quantify sensitivities of option prices and assist in risk management strategies.

8. **Integrated Computational Techniques**  
   Implementation of all models and simulations primarily in Python, emphasizing reproducibility, efficiency, and clarity.
